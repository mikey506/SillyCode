## Overview

This project explores the interconnected archetypes of Witches, Androids, and Mystics through the lens of neurochemistry, brainwave patterns, and cognitive functions. Using a visually engaging 3D model, it bridges scientific insights with archetypal concepts, offering a unique perspective on mental processes and their practical applications.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Model**: Visualize the relationship between brainwave frequencies, neurotransmitters, and archetypes.
- **Scientific Foundations**: Data-driven insights connecting neurochemistry with emotional and cognitive patterns.
- **Archetypal Framework**: Provides a structured view of how Witches, Androids, and Mystics correspond to brain activity.
- **Educational Value**: Great for workshops, presentations, or personal exploration into neuroscience and psychology.

## Archetypes & Brainwave Connections

### 1. **Witches**
- **Frequency**: 7.83 Hz (Alpha/Theta Waves)
- **Neurotransmitter Impact**: Enhances GABA for calm and creativity.
- **Effects**: Promotes relaxation, emotional grounding, and intuitive insights.

### 2. **Androids**
- **Frequency**: 14.3 Hz (Low Beta Waves)
- **Neurotransmitter Impact**: Boosts norepinephrine for focus and attention.
- **Effects**: Improves problem-solving, detail orientation, and concentration.

### 3. **Mystics**
- **Frequency**: 33.8 Hz (Gamma Waves)
- **Neurotransmitter Impact**: Supports abstract thinking with heightened cognitive stimulation.
- **Effects**: Encourages complex problem-solving and metaphysical insights.

## Installation

To explore the 3D model:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/archetypes-3d-model.git
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
